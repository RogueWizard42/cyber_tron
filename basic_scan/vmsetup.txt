🔧 Goal:
Set up a private, offline network in VMware for scanning practice using:

- Kali Linux (attacker)
- Windows 10 (target)
- Android x86 (target)

No internet needed. Just local traffic.

---

🌐 Network Details:
- Network: vmnet1 (host-only)
- Subnet: 172.16.252.0/24
- Gateway: 172.16.252.1 (VMware’s default for vmnet1)

Static IPs assigned:
- Kali: 172.16.252.10
- Windows 10: 172.16.252.20
- Android: 172.16.252.40

---

🛠 Problems Encountered:
1. **Kali couldn’t ping Android**
   - Checked Android’s network interface — it was up with correct IP
   - Flushed iptables just in case (`iptables -F`)
   - Added default gateway manually:
     `ip route add default via 172.16.252.1 dev wifi_eth`
   - Still couldn’t ping Kali from Android

2. **Used Nmap instead**
   - Ran: `nmap -sP 172.16.252.0/24`
   - Android showed up as “host is up” — so it's reachable even if ping doesn’t work
   - That’s good enough for scanning!

---

✅ Result:
- All three VMs are connected and working inside vmnet1
- Ping may not work on Android, but Nmap detects it — so we’re good to go

---

🧠 Takeaways:
- Don’t rely only on ping — tools like Nmap can confirm hosts even when ping fails
- Android x86 is quirky — just get it to show up in a scan and call it a win
- Manual IP setup is key when using host-only networks

---

Next Step: Make a simple diagram of the network layout and begin scanning tasks.
