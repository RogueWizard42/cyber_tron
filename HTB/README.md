### Hack The Box: The Proving Grounds

This section is dedicated to the labs and challenges from **Hack The Box**. Each directory contains my notes on deconstructing a specific vulnerable systemâ€”from initial enumeration to final privilege escalation.

The goal is to document the process, refine my methodology, and learn from every engagement.

#### What's Inside

Inside each machine's directory, you can expect to find:

* **Write-ups & Walkthroughs:** Detailed notes chronicling the process of each compromise.
* **Custom Scripts & Payloads:** Any code developed to assist in enumeration or exploitation.
* **Field Notes:** Observations on methodology, lessons learned, and interesting attack vectors.

> **The Rule of Engagement:** All activity documented here is performed in the controlled and sanctioned Hack The Box lab environment. No unauthorized systems are ever targeted.
