### First Steps: The Starting Point Codex

Here lie the first inscriptions in the logbook. This archive contains my notes from the "Starting Point" series from Hack The Boxâ€”a set of foundational lessons designed to forge an apprentice's core skills.

These machines are the initial trials, focusing on the fundamental tools and principles of the craft before moving on to more complex constructs.

#### The Apprentice's Focus

The primary goal of these labs is to build fluency in:

* **Reconnaissance & Enumeration:** Learning to map the terrain and identify entry points on a target.
* **Basic Tooling:** Gaining proficiency with essential tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and web enumeration utilities.
* **Understanding Entry Points:** Practicing the fundamentals of gaining an initial foothold on a system.

> Every master was once a beginner. Every incantation starts with a single rune.
