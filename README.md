# 🛡️ cyber_tron

Welcome to cyber_tron — my personal playground for ethical hacking and cybersecurity experimentation.
This is where I explore offensive and defensive security concepts, practice with tools like Nmap, John the Ripper, and Metasploit, and work through vulnerable machine labs and network simulations. Some projects succeed, some break, and all of them teach me something.

   - ⚠️ All work is performed in isolated lab environments for educational purposes only.

## 🧱 What's Inside

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Recon & Enumeration** – Nmap scans, service discovery, and target mapping
- 💥 **Exploitation Attempts** – Web app testing, SQL injection, brute force tools, etc.
- 🧠 **Write-ups & Walkthroughs** – Notes, screenshots, and analysis of each project
- 🧰 **Toolchains in Practice** – Using and testing tools like Burp Suite, John the Ripper, Wireshark, and more

Some projects use scripts from my other repos to streamline attacks or speed up recon.

All activity documented here is done in **controlled lab environments** for educational purposes only. No testing is performed against unauthorized systems.

## 🧙‍♂️ About the Lab

This isn’t a showcase of polished results — it’s a field journal. I learn by doing, breaking, testing, and improving. Everything in this repo represents time spent building real experience in ethical hacking.
