# 🧪 dark_arts_lab

Welcome to **dark_arts_lab** — my personal hacking(ethical!) and experimentation zone.

This is where I explore offensive and defensive security concepts, test tools, poke at vulnerable machines, and figure things out the hard way. Some of it works, some of it breaks, but that's all the fun of it.

## 🧱 What's Inside

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Recon & Enumeration** – Nmap scans, service discovery, and target mapping
- 💥 **Exploitation Attempts** – Web app testing, SQL injection, brute force tools, etc.
- 🧠 **Write-ups & Walkthroughs** – Notes, screenshots, and analysis of each project
- 🧰 **Toolchains in Practice** – Using and testing tools like Burp Suite, John the Ripper, Wireshark, and more

Some projects use scripts from my other repos to streamline attacks or speed up recon.

## 🧙‍♂️ About the Lab

This isn’t a showcase of polished results — it’s a field journal. I learn by doing, breaking, testing, and improving. Everything in this repo represents time spent building real experience in ethical hacking.
